# H-1B and Technology

For this project, I wanted to look at the changes in approvals, denials, and RFE's for H-1B visas have changed since 2015, how this has affected Tech Companies, and the possible roadblocks companies may face when trying to sponsor someone to fill a specialized position.

### Problem Statement
Denials of H-1B Visas has resulted in the inability to fulfill the demand of tech jobs (jobs in tech). Using tech training companies as a bridge with potential tech career minded individuals could help fill those jobs.
